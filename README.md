# First_web_site
My first website created during my studies.

This website was created for a fictional sports club. I chose figure skating as the sport. The graphic design of the website was created by me, using Figma.
Within this website, users can create an account and log in using their credentials. Once logged in, they can upload administrative documents, which are directly sent to the database linked to the website.
